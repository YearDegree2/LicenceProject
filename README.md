LicenceProject
==============

Licence project by [Nicolas BASCON](https://github.com/nicobascon) and [Yannis RICHARD](https://github.com/yannisrichard).

Proposed by [Sebastien SALVA](http://sebastien.salva.free.fr/), we had to create web services for a teacher-searcher like website. The whole website, using our web services, is [here](https://github.com/mickaelstorm2703/site_chercheur_licence).

All paths are in the folder controllers in app/config.

All functional tests are in the folder Functional in tests/Appli/Tests.
